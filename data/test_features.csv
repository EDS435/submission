alvh,"LE was dispatched to a residence to take a missing persons report from a mother who was making a report that her son (a XX XX) was missing and had not been heard from in 3 hours. He was driving her vehicle. She reported that he has a history of suicidal attempts and she believes he is in danger as he had not been taking his prescribed medication for over a week and his behaviors seemed a bit off. Also, she discovered the story he gave her about spending tonight at a friends house was entirely untrue. While at the residence state patrol officers arrived to notify the parents that their vehicle was involved a crash and the fatality at the scene appeared to be their son. Per State Patrol: There were  no tire mark evidence on the roadway to show there was any braking, swerving, avoidance maneuver, or over steering performed. There was no visible tire mark evidence on the roadway at all. The tire marks on the roadside leading to the bridge wall were ""rolling tire"" marks caused by the vehicle driving on the roadside, again, no evidence of braking or even steering. The tire tracks led straight into the bridge wall. There were no braking tire marks to use to perform energy related calculations for speed. The crush damage to the front end of that vehicle was SEVERE. That alone indicates a rather extreme speed, but with current methodologies in use an exact speed cannot be assigned to the crush damage. Either the driving conduct was intentional or the driver was incapacitated ((unconscious, medical episode?) and not able to control the vehicle.","V is a XX XX with a history of depression, who was the driver and sole occupant of a car that left the roadway and crashed into a bridge support (wall) at a high rate of speed, then caught fire.

The V told his mother that he and another friend were spending the night over at a friend's house. The V had called his mother when he had arrived at the friends house and before he hung up, he said, ""Bye I love you."" The mother thought this was odd and felt something seemed off. She then drove over to the friend's house where her son was supposed to be spending the night and the friend's father said his son was not home as he was in IA. The mother then called the friend who was supposed to be with her son, and when the mother asked to talk to her son, the friend said he was not available. The mother confronted the friend and she told that she knew he was lying and he eventually admitted that her son had contacted him out of the blue and asked him to lie for him and make something up if his mom called asking where he was. The mother then called LE to report her son missing. The mother stated her son has not been taking his antidepressants and had been throwing them in the garbage. He has history of suicide attempts and cutting himself and has also burned his face with a lighter on purpose.The father stated that his son was seeing a psyche doctor for depression along with going to a mental health clinic for treatment. The NOK stated that one year ago his son tried to commit suicide and then again 3 weeks ago when he was really low/depressed.

He stated that the V doesn't use any social drugs, ETOH or tobacco.Per the NOK (mother): She stated that in the past few weeks his behavior has changed.

The reporting party (RP) had called stating that the V had shot himself and told the dispatch his name; a second caller identified himself as one of the neighboring apartments of the one that the incident occurred and he described a group of individuals running, crying and shouting out ""they are going to kill us."" An elderly woman (concerned party 1/CP1) who lived next-door heard the firearm discharged and heard sudden screams from where the shot originated from. She ran to discover what had happened and administered CPR on the V until she realized he was deceased. As officers arrived, they observed a bigger group of people running around the alleged apartment in a frantic movement and yelling at each other. Officers formed an immediate action team to gain access to the residence through the bystanders, control and restrain the crowd and clear the premises of any harm; once done EMS were allowed to administer aid but eventually pronounced the V dead at 2316 hours. The bullet had traveled through the V's head through the apartment wall into the neighboring apartment's kitchen by the front door.Officers began to question the individuals present during the incident received a plethora of contradicting information. Almost all of them stated they were not looking when the V discharged the firearm; many however were able to say they saw the V playing with the firearm a few moments before. Overall many of them were confused as to why the V would have taken his life and believed it to be an accident; they noted the night as fun with no arguments. The owner of the apartment (W) stated that he and his older brother lived in the apartment. The group was all hanging out drinking alcohol preparing to go to a party afterward (although a few of the other witnesses denied any alcohol consumption at the incident) and that the V had been sharing a bottle of brandy with the W and another friend. The W stated that he believed the V had also smoked some marijuana prior but was unsure. The V and another friend had been staying with the W for the last week because of some disagreement the V had with his mother that the W was not sure about. The W stated that his brother kept two firearms, a Glock 9mm and a .357 magnum revolver(officers confirmed it was the Glock used in the incident), located in the top drawer of a dresser in a bedroom closet inside an unsecured lockbox intended just for emergencies. He recalls witnessing the V go into the W's brothers room to grab the firearm; heard the V rack a round into the chamber, then heard a loud noise and turned to see the V on the ground. They all ran from the apartment but the W returned to check on the wellbeing of the V and moved the firearm from the floor to the couch. Officers identified one of the witnesses to be the V's girlfriend/friend (witness 2/W2). The W2 stated that she and the V had been dating (on and off) for the past two years and that the plan for the evening was to go to the W's house to hang out. W2 estimated that she had been in the apartment for about 20 minutes before the V retrieved the firearm from a location she was unaware of. She witnessed the V point the gun at one of his friends (witness 3/W3) in a joking manner and smiled. When his friends told him to ""stop being stupid with a gun"" he then pointed the gun to his own head and immediately pulled the trigger. W2 reported noticing the V being very quiet that evening leading up to the incident. The V's mother soon arrived on scene and was questioned by officers. She stated that they had a good relationship but often times ""had their differences."" The two had been texting earlier in the day but nothing seemed to be out of the normal to the V's mother. She told officers that the V had just recently completed probation for an incident where he had stolen a firearm. She also reported the V had attempted to harm himself 2 years prior.ME's office concluded that the cause of death was a gunshot wound of the head and the manner of death was ruled a suicide.

The Victim was seen pulling back the slide and loading the 9mm Glock pistol. The Victim's friend again asked him to stop fooling around and when the Victim refused he turned away and heard a pop. The Victim was then seen falling to the ground and a few members of the party left while others went to the next door apartment to get help. 911 was called at 2306 hours and the Victim was pronounced on scene by EMS as 2316 hours. When officers responded to the scene they noted the residence was in below average upkeep and that there were dishes filling the kitchen sink as well as empty alcohol bottles on the counters. Two to-go style drink containers were also located, one was reported to be the Victim's and contained alcohol. An apparent bullet hole was located on the southeast wall of the residence. It was reported the Victim had a history of tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine use. The Victim had one previous incident of suicidal threat a year previous when he grabbed a knife. Upon examination the ME noted a single contact range gunshot wound to the Victim's right temporal scalp, travelling right to left, front to back, and slightly upwards before exiting the left parietal scalp.

asyb,"V was XXXX. V was found in a park deceased as the result of an intentional overdose that was suicidal in nature. It is unknown if EMS was on scene. V's medical history includes depression with treatment at a mental health clinic. V had started a new medication ""for depression and such"" 2 weeks prior and had been having more severe thoughts of suicide recently. V reached out to the mental health clinic who told her to give the medication time to work and to just get through it. According to V's husband, they have had problems recently. V was reportedly angry towards everything, and the two would argue. 2 days prior to injury, after arguing for 3 days straight, V asked her husband to leave. He did leave for the day but returned later that evening, and he reported that everything seemed better; the arguments were not resolved though. The day of injury, V and her husband had an argument about the husband not wanting to accompany V on a trip to sell something and attend an appointment with a school. V left the residence and called a crisis line to report that she had taken every pill in her house and wanted to die. LE was informed and began to search for V. V had also called her mother and reported that her marriage was over because her husband had cheated on her, that they were unable to pay their bills, and that they are getting kicked out of the house. V also told her mother that she loved her, that it would be better this way, and that they would not be able to find her where she was going. V had also told her husband that she was going to kill herself and later texted him that she was not going to do anything. Later, V texted him, ""I love you to death and I know you can't stand me anymore so I just took all of the pills in the house and I'm driving and I'm going to park somewhere until I go I can't handle it anymore and I love you and you deserve someone who won't yell at you every day.""

While at the residence, he saw that her pill bottles were empty and there was a bottle of acetaminophen dumped on the counter. V was found later that day deceased.

athg,"Victim, a XX XX, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.  According to the victim's father, the victim had been in her bedroom at home with her boyfriend, when suddenly she came out of the bedroom, went towards a back room where  the gun safes are kept, and went into the bathroom and locked the door. He thought she appeared to have tears in her eyes, and he thought perhaps she and her boyfriend had a disagreement; however he had not heard any arguing of any sort. He spoke with her and tried to get her out of the bathroom, but she told her father to go get her boyfriend. At this point he noticed the door open on the gun cabinet in the bedroom next to the bathroom and before he had time to react, he heard a ""pop"" come from the bathroom. He kicked in the bathroom door and saw the victim on the ground with blood coming from her head, and called 911. The victim was med-flighted to a children's hospital where doctors told the victim's parents that the victim was not expected to survive and put organ procurement in touch with them. The victim died two days after being admitted to the hospital. Doctors advised of significant bruising on the victim's body; however it was not a contributing factor in the victim's death. Interviews regarding the bruising only gave answers of the victim being a playful, rough person and also bruised easily. The mother was aware of one large bruise from gym class. The victim's boyfriend told police that they had been ""discussing"" their relationship and he had told the victim that he felt betrayed because she had been sending nude photos to other people and ""sleeping around"". (No pictures of concerning nature were found in the victim's phone) He told the victim that he needed to leave and began to put his shirt and shoes on. He said the victim wasn't sure if he was breaking up with her so she tried to get him to stay. The boyfriend said the victim left the room and came back with a loaded handgun. She closed the bedroom door and told him she couldn't live without him and she didn't know what she had to do to prove she loved him. At this point he said she threatened to kill herself. He kept trying to calm her down and when he got close to her, he tried to grab the gun. They wrestled on the floor over the gun and after several minutes, he got the gun from her. The boyfriend said she left the bedroom and he unloaded the gun and put it underneath some clothes in a dresser drawer. He said as he did that, he heard the victim's father yelling that the victim had shot herself. The victim's father told him to leave because the victim's mother would kill him when she got home. He wasn't sure why the father told him the mother would kill him. It was later learned that the mother and sister believe the boyfriend to be extremely controlling of the victim and made the victim give him all her passwords to her phone and accounts and told her to stop talking with certain people. The mother said their relationship was very volatile with emotional ups and downs. The victim's mother said something to the boyfriend about this and this infuriated the victim, leading to a fight between them a few days earlier that got physical to the point where apparently the victim had her mother in a choke hold. She told her mother to stop talking with her boyfriend about these things or she would hate her forever. The mother said her contact with the boyfriend the evening prior to this incident was good, describing that they all watched television together before she left for her evening shift job. I asked the victim's father about any firearms in the residence and he stated that they are all over the place, pointing to the TV stand, behind his chair, and said there was an assault rifle in the kitchen. As law enforcement searched the apartment they did see two handguns on the TV stand and also saw the AR-15 sitting on top of a pile of clothes. Numerous piles of debris and garbage were all about the outside of the trailer home and on the attached deck and the inside of the home was very cluttered. In one of the bedrooms, a tall gun safe was observed along with a small gun safe on top of this safe.

azlm,"V was an inmate at a correctional facility serving two life sentences for two counts of Murder 1st and one count of Murder 2nd, without possibility of parole. During the week leading up to this incident, V had been taken for evaluation then cleared by a psychiatric counselor on staff at the facility. This was following an incident where V's behavior had appeared irrational and erratic and V was making claims to be high on K2 Spice.  On the evening prior to V's death, an hour before midnight, V was transported to the emergency room at local hospital following an incident where V reportedly was observed by corrections staff striking his own head on the floor and cell bars. Reportedly corrections staff found joints inside V's cell afterwards that tested positive for synthetic cannabinoids.  The next morning V was returned to the correctional facility around 5:30 a.m. and was placed in a room inside the infirmary. V was requested to produce a urine sample at that time which was picked up several hours later, taken for testing, and had negative findings for illicit substances after full scan was completed.Corrections officers on duty had performed several routine checks on V  through the course of the morning without incident, including bringing V his breakfast, which V willingly accepted. The corrections officer stated when he returned about an hour later to retrieve the breakfast tray, it appeared V had eaten some of it. The nurse on staff at the infirmary had several conversations with V that morning, who stated V declined to allow her to check his vitals but had requested a phone call, however V was denied this privilege. V also requested a pain reliever and a change to his diet due to his injuries. The nurse advised she provided V with a Motrin and was able to change V's diet to soft foods for breakfast. A while later she responded again to V's room in the infirmary because his light was on and V then requested to speak with the mental health counselor. The nurse stated she left then returned to V's room and informed V she made the call and someone would be coming shortly to speak with him.  The nurse walked away to her station where she was V waiving at her. She asked V if he needed something and he mouthed 'thank you' to her. The nurse then told V if he needed her for anything else to use his call button. Approximately eight minutes later the corrections officer on duty went to check on V and found him unresponsive in his room and called the nurse in for assistance. V was observed sitting on the floor next to the toilet with a bed sheet twisted into a rope, tied and knotted around V's neck then connected to a grab bar. V was drooling, had no pulse, but was still warm to the touch. The corrections officer used a pocket knife to cut the sheet and the nurse commenced CPR until V was transported by ambulance some twenty minutes later to the emergency room, where he was subsequently pronounced deceased.Both the nurse on duty and the corrections officer reported V made no statements to them about harming himself or that he was having suicidal ideations. The nurse stated she was aware why V was in the infirmary because V had reported he had ingested K2 Spice. She advised investigators her interactions with V leading up to this incident that morning, V appeared blissed out, was pleasant, cooperative, but delusional. According to statements made by the captain at the correctional facility two days prior  when V had advised he had ingested K2, and was removed from his cell, no items of relevance were found on V's person or inside his cell.  After  being cleared by psychiatric staff, V was returned to his cell and later the following evening V was observed thrashing himself about on the floor of his cell, smacking his head against the floor and cell bars. Staff were unable to calm V, so they had to enter V's cell and physically restrain him. During this course of action, V broke a pair of flex-cuffs the staff had used in an attempt to restrain V. It was after this event, once V was securely restrained, the captain advised V was transported to the emergency room around 11:00 p.m.  V's cell was searched again and two 'joints' were located. These were tested and came back positive for synthetic marijuana. V was later returned to the correctional facility early the morning preceding V's attempted suicide.","V was a XX XX. The cause of death was asphyxia due to hanging. The manner of death was Suicide. Autopsy findings were consistent with a hanging with petechiael and conjunctival hemorrhages.

Other injuries noted during autopsy were multiple recent blunt force injuries to V's face, head, neck, torso, and extremities ( including abrasion and contusion injuries found about V's ankles and wrists).Some of these inflicted injuries, although none were lethal, concerned the ME office, who attributed them to possibly a result of restraint techniques used on V within twelve hours of his death.
